        <h1><i>How to stay calm under pressure.</i></h1>
        <p>Once, a reporter asked <i>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</i>, also called <b>'Cool Captain'</b> (an Indian Cricket player), "How do you keep yourself cool?". He replied, <i>"It's very simple, don't think of the result, It's the result that puts pressure on us. Take care of controllable, then you get desired results"</i>. This resembles the philosophy of stoicism.
        </p>
        <p>The philosophy of Stoicism is founded by <i>Zeno of  Cyprus</i> in 3 BCE. It is the philosophy of personal virtue ethics. Stoics believe that <i>"Virtue is sufficient for happiness"</i>. Happiness is the utmost aim of stoicism. It can be achieved by disciplined life. Stoics derived virtues to achieve the stoic way of happiness. <b>Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, and Justice are the cardinal virtues of stoicism</b>. The important teaching of stoicism is that " Don't let external events take control of your emotions". The core definition of stoicism is acceptance and indifference. We have to accept the process of nature. Or we can put it like the way <i>Epictetus</i> did “It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them.” <i>Seneca</i> said, "We suffer more in imagination than reality". 
        </p>
        <p>From the above quotes, we can understand that we don't have to worry about things that are out of our control. And also we have to accept it the way it happens. There is an interesting story of how stoicism started, In the city of Cyprus in 300 BC, there lived a very wealthy trader called Zeno. While on a voyage from Phoenicia to Piraeus, his boat sank, along with all of his cargo. Because of that single event, an event that was entirely out of Zeno’s or anyone's control, this very wealthy man suddenly became poor in an instant. Imagine you were Zeno. How would you react? What is the proper reaction? Would you be angry?  Sad? we would be wrecked and hate life for the unintended turn of events.  For most of us, these would all be normal reactions,  but not for Zeno, the father of Stoicism.
        </p>
        <p>Zeno reframed his mindset and the reframing of his mindset had a cascading impact on his life in later days. After reading the works of Socrates and other great philosophers, Zeno created and taught Stoicism. According to Zeno, although we don’t have much control over what happens to us, we do have control over how it affects us, and we must use this control to great effect. This is how stoicism was born and we can interpret the reason for the formation of stoicism. And the reason could be Zeno thought of why we have to worry about something that happened to us which is completely not in our control.
        </p>
        <p>There is a reason why we have to study stoicism in the current situation. In this century, people care about almost everything mainly the things that are out of their control. For example, a person worries about that he couldn't afford a car, by seeing some random person's car collection in his garage. The increase in suicidal rates, hits me with the importance of stoicism in everyone's life. There is an interesting interpretation of suicide in stoicism, The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life. Suicide could be justified if one falls victim to severe pain or disease. but otherwise, <i>suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty</i>.
        </p>
        <p>We could discuss more stoicism in further episodes. From this, hope I could give a simple introduction to stoicism and its importance.
