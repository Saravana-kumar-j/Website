        <h1><i>Happiness revisited</i></h1>
        <p>Two thousand years ago <i>Aristotle</i> concluded that, more than anything else, men and women seek happiness. This is the first line of the book <a href="#">"FLOW"</a> by <b>Mihaly Csikszentmihaly</b> (September 29, 1934 - October 20, 2021). People seek happiness for their own sake. But how can anyone attain happiness when he is not aware of happiness? Before we get into the philosophy of happiness let's think at the ground level, Happiness is a pleasant emotional state. Since the 1950's there are a lot of research has been done to understand happiness. 
        </p>
        <p>When it comes to philosophy, many philosophers believe that happiness is the moral goal of life. A philosopher named <i>Henry David Thoreau</i> describes happiness like a butterfly, 'the more you chase it, it will fly away'. But when you focus completely on another thing, it will come and sit on your shoulder. When <i>J.S. Mill </i>put it together we cannot reach happiness by consciously searching for it. When it comes to <i>Victor Frankl</i> said "Don't aim at success, the more aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue."
        </p>
        <p>By considering all the above statements we can come to the point that <b>'It's not something to be obtained but to be attained'</b>. There are people out there who misunderstood happiness with pleasure, 'It is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for our advantage' thus it was mentioned in the book 'Flow'. Desire induces pleasure. That's why <i>Gautama Buddha</i> said, "Live joyfully, without desire." well he is not completely against desire many people have misconceived notions about Buddha's vision of desire.
        </p>
        <p>Happiness is not something that happens, it is a condition that must be prepared for. More like a state of mind. "There is no path to happiness, happiness is the path." <i>Gautama Buddha</i> said. 
        </p>
        <pre>
            "If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, 
            without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; 
            if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, 
            speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happily. And there is no man able to prevent this."
            
            --<b>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations.</b>
        </pre>
        
        <p><i>Marcus Aurelius</i> is a stoic philosopher. In <b>Stoicism</b>, philosophers believe that "virtue is sufficient for happiness" so stoics mainly discuss virtue more than happiness. In the words of <i>Epictetus</i> one who attains his sense of virtue would be "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy."
        </p>
        <p>I leave it here with a simple, yet a little bit-deep understanding of happiness. In later episodes, we will discuss about 'sense of virtue' in stoicism to attain happiness.
