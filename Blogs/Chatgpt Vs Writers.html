        <h3>What do writers care about in this AI-developing Era?</h3>
        Chat-GPT is an AI tool launched by OpenAI. The original versions of GPT and GPT-2 were established in 2018, and now GPT-3 was launched in 2020. When it got hyped, people gave mixed reactions, some were happy, some sad, some excited, and some inspired. And it got a shocking reaction from amateur writers, who were trying to start their carrier in the writing field.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Where AI tool lags:</h3>
        When it comes to an AI tool like Chat- GPT, it’s more like a machine trained to generate a sequence of words with pre-trained datasets of text, such as books or articles, and then fine-tuned on a specific task, such as machine translation or text generation. And there are many AI and software tools out there used for various purposes. A classic example is Grammarly, As an aspiring writer, I use Grammarly for fine-tuning my article more errorless and easy to read.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first thing that comes to my mind when it comes to writing with an AI tool was “It is completely dependent on the trained data”. As a writer, we have to research topics and collect data from various sources and curate the article with respect to the audience and publish it. The greatest disadvantage of an AI tool was the pre-trained data. The data might change over the years. We have to update its data over time regularly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Secondly, it is more objective. We as writers tend to write in both subjective and objective ways. When we write we incorporate our real-life incidents or more relatable stories to make the article more interesting and for better understanding. But AI tools like Chat-GPT won’t tell us stories if we aren’t asked for it. The creativity we’ve developed over time writing various articles, and the originality of the content we’ve constantly created won’t let us overtook by an AI tool.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, we can’t deny that AI is constantly developing one day it may overcome its limitations and create content like we are making. In that situation, we have to be a step ahead of AI.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>What would be the future of writers in AI Era?</h3>
        As I said, we can’t deny or ignore the growth of AI. Here I’m reminding a quote from Amit Ray who wrote a book called Mindfulness Meditation for Corporate Leadership and Management.
        <br>
        <br>
        “As more and more artificial intelligence is entering into the world, more and more emotional intelligence must enter into leadership.”
        <br>
        <br>
        Not only for writers, as technology continues to advance and change the nature of every work, but it is also likely that jobs that require social and emotional skills, such as the ability to communicate effectively and to work well with others, will become increasingly valuable. As writers, we have to be constantly updating and upgrading our skills. The future is complete uncertainty. I’ve figured out some of the important things that we must ensure.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>Writing skills:</i></b> Writers need to develop strong writing skills that need to be easy to communicate elegantly and effectively. 
        <br><br><b><i>Creativity:</i></b> Writers need to be able to generate new and original ideas, and present them in a way that is engaging and compelling to read.
        <br><br><b><i>Research skills:</i></b> To write accurately and confidently research plays a key role. A writer needs to be able to gather and analyze information from a variety of sources and incorporate the data in the appropriate place.
        <br><br><b><i>Adaptability:</i></b> As technology is constantly evolving, writers need to be able to adapt to new platforms and formats to reach their audience. And make use of technology to produce good-quality content.
        <br><br>To conclude, we have to think of developing our skills and creativity rather than being worried about the advancement of AI. And definitely, there are certain benefits of AI tools to writers. It makes our content more elegant and more original it unfolds different perspectives that we couldn’t think of. So my final say was that <b><i>“Don’t focus on the future now, live in present and keep upgrading every day.”</i></b>
