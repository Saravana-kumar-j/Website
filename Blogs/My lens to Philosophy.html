        <h1><i>My lens to Philosophy</i></h1>
        <p>In the quest for man's search for meaning and absolute happiness, everyone came across some philosophies, and many believe in some philosophies and try to live through them. Let's talk about philosophy itself. The term Philosophy is the Greek word <i>Philosophia</i>, "<b>love of wisdom</b>" which means the study of general and fundamental questions like reason, value, knowledge, existence, and so on. Do you believe that science is one of the branches of philosophy? In ancient times it was called Natural Philosophy, In 1687 Newton's book was named Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later it was classified as a book of physics.
        </p>
        <p></p>So philosophy's fundamental nature is to question everything. As a result, it has various branches evolved like Aesthetics, Epistemology, Ethics, Linguistics, Logic, Mental, Metaphilosophy, Metaphysics, Political, Religious, Scientific, and Social. Every philosopher was passionate about the love of wisdom in their niche, whatever it may be. <i>Thales</i> is known as 'the father of philosophy and <i>Aristotle</i> cites him as the first thinker who propose that the Universe is composed of single matter (water). So he might be the first thinker or philosopher. 
        </p>
        <p>Philosophy is everywhere, when you have a love of wisdom and a quest of searching answers for to your question that is philosophy. But now philosophy became very narrow, and mostly reflects on ethics-based subjects. And my favorite is the ethics branch of philosophy. I had a love of wisdom in ethics. Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that “involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior”. 
        </p>
    <p>Ethics is also derived from the ancient Greek term '<i>ethikos</i>' meaning 'relating to one's character' or 'relating to moral values.' <i>Rushworth Kidder</i> defines ethics as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty. And inside ethics, there are divisions like meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. My favorite branch of ethics is normative ethics – concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action. This is where Virtue ethics, Stoicism, Kantianism, and so on come in.
        </p>
        <p>It's a very compact understanding of my position in philosophy. Philosophy is a broad subject, there are thousands and a thousand pages of books in the market. This blog is not a complete comprehension of philosophy. It's my lens to view philosophy. And sure there are websites had detailed explanations about philosophy.
