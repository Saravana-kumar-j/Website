        <h1><i>Who am I? (Not about me!)</i></h1>
        <h3><i>According to Vedas and Upanishads (Hinduism)...</i></h3>
        <p>There is an interesting question would be asked when it comes to philosophy. Apart from the physical realm who am I? A few months back I came across an interesting video on YouTube which gives an analogy to answer this question. <i>Swami Sarvapriyananda</i> presented a seminar at IIT Kanpur a few years back with the topic of "Who Am I?" according to <b>Mandukya Upanishad</b>. Well here we're not going deep into Vedas and Upanishads but in the seminar, he told a story that answer the question.
        </p>
        <p><b>STORY :</b></p>
        
            <p>Once there was a king named <b>Janak Raja</b>. He was a great king with good administration and a wealthy country. One day, while he was in the bed sleeping one of his ministers, came into his room running and woke up the king with a trembling voice he said: " Maharaj enemy attacked us !". King suddenly woke up and got ready for the war and prepared his troops to tackle the entry of the enemy king into his state.
            </p>
            <p>In the war, he was heavily defeated with almost all his men either getting killed or captured. The enemy king didn’t kill Raja Janaka but ordered him to exile the country. Janak raja was exhausted and very tired after the war. And he started walking to another country immediately after the war after 2 days he finally reached the border of his country. 
            </p>
            <p>On the opposite side, he saw an almsgiving event going on followed by a long queue standby. Janak was very tired and hungry so he also stands in the long queue after a few hours of standing in line he finally made it to reach the counter. by the time he reached the counter the food was finished. He was broken down and got to the ground. The man on the counter gets a very little amount of food by collecting the bit and remains of the vessels he served and giving it to Janak raja.
            </p>
            <p>Janak raja praised him and started eating, at that time a bird came out of nowhere and hit Raja. He fell down and the food he got fell on the ground and get wasted. He started crying loudly and loudly. Suddenly a man woke up the king and King realized it was a dream. he was amazed at the ‘realness’ of the dream, Janaka started pondering whether his current state with all its magnificence is true or his dreaming state with all the misery is true. 
            </p>
            <p>Days passed & the king kept on repeating only one question - <i><b>is this true or that true</b></i>. This got all the ministers worried as all the important work of the kingdom was getting stalled. Soon, this news spread throughout the kingdom & people started gossiping (in a bad/funny way) about the king’s condition.
            </p>
            <p>During the same time, A Sage named <b>Ashtavakra</b> was passing through the city & since he was a sage, he knew everything! Therefore, he decided to visit Janaka & help him resolve his issue. The sage asked a few questions.
            </p>
        <p><b>Sage</b>: Mahraj, How are you?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: Is this true or that true. (As usual)
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Sage knows what he is referring to anyone else couldn't understand.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: Mahraj, When you were rolling in the dust bleeding, tired, defeated, depressed, and drained. At that time all the power, wealth, ministers, soldiers, and all these here were there?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: NO!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: And now you are sitting here with all the power, wealth, ministers all the things. Those defeats, miseries, and all those terrible things were here?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: NO!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: Neither this is true nor that is true.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: Then nothing is true.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: At that place in the dream, were you there or not?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: Yes, I'm there I'm experiencing it all.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: Now you're here or not?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>King</b>: Yes, I'm experiencing this too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sage</b>: Neither THIS (present state) nor THAT (dreaming state) is true, only You witnessing both the situations <i><b>YOU</b></i> alone are true! 
        </p>
        <p>This is the story. In this blog, I just want to tell the story alone. We'll analyze it in the later episodes.
