            B.Sc., Physics in Vivekananda college, Madurai. But then I got to study for UPSC for another two 
            years. It's not really connect to me but I give it a try. But all the time along, I studied coding
            here and there and managed to create this website and Then I realised my interest in 
            Computer science especially coding and stuffs. I managed to get out from UPSC and want to 
            curate my passion and hone my skills. So, yeah here I am now. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I don't have computer science background, but <b><i>I do have interest and undying passion</i></b> to learn 
            in this field.
            <br>
